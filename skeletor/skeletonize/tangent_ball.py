    """Skeletonize a contracted mesh by finding the maximal tangent ball.

    Notes
    -----
    Based on the algorithm presented in Ma et al. (2012) (see references).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh :          mesh obj
                    The mesh to be skeletonize. Can an object that has
                    ``.vertices`` and ``.faces`` properties  (e.g. a
                    trimesh.Trimesh) or a tuple ``(vertices, faces)`` or a
                    dictionary ``{'vertices': vertices, 'faces': faces}``.
    step_size :     'auto'
    output :        "swc" | "graph" | "both"
                    Determines the function's output. See ``Returns``.
    progress :      bool
                    If True, will show progress bar.

    Returns
    -------
    "swc" :         pandas.DataFrame
                    SWC representation of the skeleton.
    "graph" :       networkx.Graph
                    Graph representation of the skeleton.
    "both" :        tuple
                    Both of the above: ``(swc, graph)``.
